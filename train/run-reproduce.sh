# Reproduce phase — can a fresh agent get a published project running from
# its README alone?
#
# Every other grader reads files. train/scorecard.md decides all eight of its
# checks by reading, and the testcase `## Review` section is read-only by
# construction. Structure is the one thing the skill is reliably good at, so
# both graders sit at their maximum and stop moving. This one asks the
# question neither can: does the artefact work for somebody who wasn't there
# when it was built.
#
# It is NOT a boot test. The build agent already boots the project and
# auto-fixes until it does, so "does it boot" passes by construction. What is
# untested is whether it boots for a second party following only what got
# written down — which is where this week's defects lived: host ports remapped
# for the build machine, an env var the settings read that .env.example never
# lists, a step performed but never documented.
#
# Arm-neutral. The baseline arm has a README too, and the control was asked
# for one by the same `## Prompt`.
#
# The tree under test comes from `git archive HEAD` — exactly what a user gets
# by cloning, with .venv, .env and the database left behind. That is the whole
# point, so the script refuses to run against a project with uncommitted
# changes rather than grade something nobody can download.
#
# Usage (run from inside seedkit-examples/train/):
#   ./run-reproduce.sh                       # every case, skill arm
#   ./run-reproduce.sh 02 07                 # specific ones
#   ARM=baseline ./run-reproduce.sh          # control arm, baselines/sonnet/
#   ARM=baseline MODEL=claude-opus-5 ./run-reproduce.sh
#
# Requires: claude CLI, jq, python3, git, and whatever the projects need
# (uv, docker) — a missing project dependency is reported as BLOCKED, not
# FAIL, since it says nothing about the generated project.

You have just cloned this repository. The current working directory is its
root. You have never seen it before and you know nothing about it beyond what
is written down here.

Your job: get it running locally, following its own documentation.

Rules:

- `README.md` is your instructions. Read it first and follow it literally.
- You may read any file in this directory to diagnose a problem, but the
  README is what you are testing. Every time you have to work something out
  that the README did not tell you, that is a finding — record it.
- Do not edit any file in the project to make it work. This is an audit of
  what was published, not a repair job. The one exception is a value you are
  clearly expected to supply yourself (copying `.env.example` to `.env` and
  filling it in, for instance) — that is normal setup, not a fix.
- If a host port is already taken by an unrelated service on this machine,
  that is this machine's problem, not the project's. Work around it and record
  it as a NOTE, not a GAP.
- Stop as soon as the project is demonstrably running: the documented run
  command works and the documented entry point answers. Do not go on to
  exercise features.

When you are done, finish your reply with this block and nothing after it:

REPRODUCE PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED
GAP <one line: what you had to work out that the README should have said>
NOTE <one line: machine-local workarounds — taken ports, missing daemons>

Use PASS when it ended up running. Use FAIL when it did not, and make the
first GAP line the reason. Use BLOCKED only when this machine cannot run it at
all through no fault of the project — no Docker daemon for a project that
needs one, say — and name what was missing on the NOTE line.

A GAP is not a style complaint. It is something a competent person following
the README would get stuck on or get wrong.
